//What is kueue?
{kueue-l} is a job and resource management system for {product-title} clusters.

// Who should / when should someone use Kueue?
{kueue-s} is compatible with environments that use heterogeneous, elastic resources. This means that the environment has many different resource types, and those resources are capable of dynamic scaling.

// Personas
[id="about-kueue-personas"]
== {kueue-s} personas

There are two different personas used in a {kueue-s} workflow; batch administrators, and batch users.

A batch administrator manages the cluster infrastructure and establishes quotas and queues.

As a batch administrator, you can complete the following tasks:

- Setup role-based access control to Kueue objects.
- Administer cluster quotas by using cluster queues and local queues.
- Setup "all-or-nothing" with ready pods.
- Monitor pending workloads.
- Run Kueue-managed jobs with a custom workload priorities.
- Setup a multi-Kueue environment.
- Use a third-party certificate authority with Kueue.

// How it works
[id="about-kueue-workflow"]
== {kueue-s} workflow

// TODO: add diagram

The {kueue-s} workflow can be described at a high level as follows:

. Batch administrators create and configure resource flavors and queues.
. Batch users create jobs on the cluster.
. The `kube-apiserver` component validates and accepts job data.
. {kueue-s} admits jobs based on configured options, such as order or quota.
// how does nodeaffinity work
. The job controller creates pods.
. The `kube-scheduler` component assigns pods to a node in the cluster.
. The `cluster-autoscaler` component provisions more nodes as required.
